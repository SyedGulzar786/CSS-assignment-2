      <h2 class="chocolate atif">Our Story</h2>
      <p class="teal arjit">Our restaurant was founded in 1999 by husband and wife team, John and Maria Smith. With a shared love of food and a dream of opening their own restaurant, they transformed a small storefront into a cozy dining space that quickly became a local favorite.</p>
      <p class="teal arjit">Over the years, our restaurant has grown in size and reputation, but our commitment to quality and hospitality remains the same. We are proud to be a part of the community and look forward to serving you and your family for years to come.</p>
